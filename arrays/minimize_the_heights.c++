// Given an array arr[] denoting heights of N towers and a positive integer K,
//  you have to modify the height of each tower either by increasing or decreasing
//   them by K only once. After modifying, height should be a non-negative integer. 
// Find out the minimum possible difference of the height of shortest and longest
//  towers after you have modified each tower.
// Note: It is compulsory to increase or decrease (if possible) by K to each tower.



// Input:
// K = 2, N = 4
// Arr[] = {1, 5, 8, 10}
// Output:
// 5
// Explanation:
// The array can be modified as 
// {3, 3, 6, 8}. The difference between 
// the largest and the smallest is 8-3 = 5.

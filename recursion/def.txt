Definition : A function calling itself until it met some condition(generally called as base condition)

If we dont write the base case then it will call itself infinitely 
which causes stack overflow . 



while it is calling itself a recursion stack is maintained . 
If we call continuosly with out specifying the base condition then 
we will get an error called stack overflow , which means the stack is full
no more furthur calls happen.

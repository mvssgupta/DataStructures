Generally stack can be used in the following scenario's:-

If we have a solution to a problem in O(n^2) by using two for-loops-
    If the inner loop is dependent on the outer loop then we can improve the solution 
    to this problem from O(n^2) to O(n) by using stack.

    inner loop dependent on outer loop as follows:-
     
    1) 
    while the inner loop is from 0 to i
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        for(int j=0;j<i;j++)

    2)
    while the inner loop is from i to 0
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        for(int j=i;j>=0;j--)

    3)
    while the inner loop is from i to n
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        for(int j=i;j<n;j++)
    4) 
    while the inner loop is from n to i
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        for(int j=n;j>=i;j--)

In the above four cases we can improve the timecomplexity from O(n^2) to O(n) by using stack.
